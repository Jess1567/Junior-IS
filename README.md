Junior IS Website: Lullaby Lit
Lullaby Lit is a website created for people who love to read stories and poems. The intent of this website is to allow users to unwind and relax while reading literature before bed. This project was used to focus on UI/UX design priciples and impliment them into a website.
The plan is to have the software done by April 7th and hopefully I am approved to start collecting data the week of April 8th.
